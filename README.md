Hey there, reader! :wave:

My name is Athitya Kumar - yup, everyone gets the spelling and/or pronunciation wrong. I'm a graduate from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (batch of 2019) and I'm currently employed at Intuit India. :tada:

I love writing - be it code, or blog. I've recently renewed my practise of blogging; you can find me writing at:

- [My Own Blog](https://athityakumar.github.io/blog/page_1/)
- [Medium](https://medium.com/@athityakumar)

Checkout [my website](https://athityakumar.github.io/) to get to know more about me, and/or to dig up my social media profiles to stalk. ðŸ˜›
